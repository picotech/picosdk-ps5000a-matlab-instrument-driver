# PicoScope 5000 Series (A API) - MATLAB Generic Instrument Driver

This MATLAB<sup>®</sup> Generic Instrument Driver allows you to acquire data from the PicoScope<sup>®</sup> 5000 Series Flexible Resolution Oscilloscopes and control built-in signal generator functionality. The data could be processed in MATLAB using functions from Toolboxes such as [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html). 

The driver has been updated using Instrument Control Toolbox v3.13. 

This Instrument Driver package includes the following: 

* The MATLAB Generic Instrument Driver 
* Example scripts that demonstrate how to call functions in order to capture data in various collection modes, as well as using the signal generator.

The driver can be used with the Test and Measurement Tool to carry out the following: 

  * Acquire data in Block mode 
  * Acquire data in Rapid Block mode 
  * Use the Built-in Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator (model-dependent)

## Supported Models

The driver will work with the following PicoScope models:

* PicoScope 5242A/B/D/D MSO & 5442A/B/D/D MSO
* PicoScope 5243A/B/D/D MSO & 5443A/B/D/D MSO  
* PicoScope 5244A/B/D/D MSO & 5444A/B/D/D MSO

**Note:** The driver will not work with the [PicoScope 5203 and 5204](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/59657-picoscope-5203-and-5204-examples) devices.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

* [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for Microsoft Windows (32- or 64-bit) or Linux operating systems (64-bit).
* [Instrument Control Toolbox](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/products/instrument/)
* The [PicoScope Support Toolbox](http://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53681-picoscope-support-toolbox)
* The [PicoSDK C Wrapper Binaries](https://github.com/picotech/picosdk-c-wrappers-binaries)

**Note:** MATLAB 2015b is recommended for 32-bit versions of MATLAB on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

### Installing the Instrument Driver files

We recommend using the [Add-Ons Explorer](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/get-add-ons.html) in MATLAB in order to install these files and obtain updates.

If your version of MATLAB does not have the Add-Ons Explorer, download the zip file from the [MATLAB Central File Exchange page](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42820-picoscope-5000-series-matlab-generic-instrument-driver)
 and add the root and subfolders to the MATLAB path.

### Installing drivers

Drivers are available for the following platforms. Refer to the subsections below for further information.

#### Windows

* Download the PicoSDK (32-bit or 64-bit) driver package installer from our [Downloads page](https://www.picotech.com/downloads).

#### Linux

* Follow the instructions on our [Linux Software & Drivers for Oscilloscopes and Data Loggers page](https://www.picotech.com/downloads/linux) to install the required `libps5000a` and `libpswrappers` driver packages.
